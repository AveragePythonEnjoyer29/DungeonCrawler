# DungeonCrawler

A dungeon crawler i wrote in Python 3.10, without any engine. Note that some code might be sloppy, but i tried my best to document everything.

# Known issues
- Pressing any movement key twice will duplicate the player entity (Not sure what causes this)
- Hitting a trap with your sword results in a crash (Fix found, will implement soon)
